# Assignment 2: Memory Bug Exploitation in C

In this assignment you will implement buffer-overflow attacks to hijack
victim programs.

These victim programs have been stripped down to minimal examples to
highlight the step where an unsafe memory operation can be exploited
to take control of a program. In practice, getting to this stage can
take many tedious days (or longer) by a team of analysts. And even when the
unsafe operations are found, they are frequently much more difficult to
exploit due to un-fun complicating factors.

## Your Tasks


The directory `targets` contains the `C` source code of victim programs you'll attack. 

In the directory `sploits` you will find skeleton files `sploit0.c`, ..., `sploit5.c`, along with `shellcode.h`. These files can be compiled with the makefile included in that directory. When run, the skeleton code will execute their respective target from `/tmp/`. The `args` array are the command line arguments passed to the target. You shouldn't modify `env`, except perhaps for `sploit5` (and even then there are other ways to finish that problem).

You will modify files `sploit0.c`, ..., `sploit5.c` so that each, when compiled and run, executes the appropriate target and obtains a shell. When you get a shell, a bare-bone prompt that is simply a `#` will appear. You can run commands at the shell, celebrate your success, and then close it.
